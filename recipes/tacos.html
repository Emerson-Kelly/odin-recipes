        <h3>INGREDIENTS YOU’LL NEED</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Ground Beef: </b>This taco recipe calls for ground beef, but you can substitute ground turkey if you
                prefer ground turkey tacos.</li>
            <li><b>Taco Seasoning: </b>To season the taco meat you’ll need chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, dried
                oregano, onion powder, salt and pepper. This simple mix of seasonings makes the most flavorful tacos!
                The seasoning blend is similar to this taco seasoning recipe, but I’ve included the individual seasoning
                amounts in this recipe for convenience. If you keep a batch of homemade taco seasoning on hand in your
                kitchen, you can use about 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning instead of the individual seasonings in this
                recipe.</li>
            <li><b>Tomato Sauce & Water: </b>Adding both tomato sauce and water ensures that your taco meat will be
                moist and flavorful. The water cooks off as the taco meat simmers in the seasonings; it helps to keep
                the meat from drying out.</li>
            <li><b>Tortillas: </b>You can serve your tacos in crunchy taco shells or soft tortillas. Use what your
                family likes best.</li>
            <li><b>Taco Toppings: </b>Tacos are the best when you load them up with toppings! See my suggestions below
                or use your favorites.</li>
        </ol>
